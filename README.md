Data reduction is performing with version 6.6.3.22 of the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA; McMullin et al. 2007) software package. 
This observation was performed on M31 via VLA Telescope and in 3 bands, L,S,C Bands. Unfortunately, due to the solar activities the L band has been lost and it did not have any polarization signal. 
I have reduced S band, this band was full of RFI, it could be considered as a hardwork. 
The goal of this observation is to examine segments of the spiral arms with angular sizes of 6â€™ at a resolution.
